 *Im to broke to buy a domain so i used Z.AI ai to 1. host the domain. 2. dont have to script the webpage*

Cody is a comprehensive, open-source alternative to tools like Claude Code. Built for developers who prefer the speed and efficiency of the command line, it brings high-level AI coding assistance directly to your terminal.

## 👨‍💻 Development & Vision
Currently, this is a solo-developer passion project. I’m excited to share my progress with the community and build an agent that truly rivals the best tools on the market.

## 📅 Update Schedule
To ensure quality and steady progress, I push updates on a flexible schedule based on the complexity of the features:

* **Weekly:** Minor improvements and bug fixes.
* **Bi-Weekly:** Standard feature rollouts.
* **Semi-Monthly:** Major architectural changes or complex milestones.
* **Monthly:** Insane system fixes and more complex & powerfull features.

**Do Bugs Appear**

* **Like all bugs when updates come bugs will be fixed if you can tell me about bugs in the commments then that will be super helpfull so i can fix them**

## 📋 Prerequisites
* **API Provider:** You must use your own AI provider/API key.
* **Runtime:** You must have **Bun** installed on your machine.
    * *Note: Node.js is supported, but you will need to manually configure the files to work with the Node environment.*

## ❓ Questions and Answers

**Q: Does this work with all providers?**  
**A:** Yes, Cody is designed to work with all major AI providers.

**Q: Why use Bun?**  
**A:** Similar to Claude Code, Cody utilizes Bun for its incredible speed. Using Bun ensures that the CLI remains blazing fast when handling API calls and file operations.

**Q: Can I fork or repost this on my own profile with my own changes?**  
**A:** I highly encourage developers to do that! It is a great way to showcase cool add-ons you have built. I only ask that you please provide credit to the original project (it isn't mandatory, but highly appreciated!).

**Q: What is the main focus of this project?**  
**A:** To give developers the freedom to use AI in their terminals without being locked into only using Claude Code, GPT Codex, or Gemini CLI.
